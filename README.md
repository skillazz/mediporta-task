# Description

This task involves creating a paginated table or list of tags along with the count of associated posts (count field). The number of elements per page should be configurable using a numeric field above the table/list. Sorting field and direction should be selectable through a custom UI element. Additionally, appropriate states for data loading and error handling during retrieval should be prepared. The task requires utilizing a ready-made UI component library, such as MUI, and existing state management and data fetching libraries (selection based on project complexity and speed of task completion). A Storybook should be prepared to showcase the used application components. The solution should be published in a GitHub repository and should run solely by executing the commands "npm ci", "npm start", "npm run storybook".
